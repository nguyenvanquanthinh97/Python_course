At least eight local residents have confirmed positive for the virus over the past two days, ending Viet Nam’s 34-day streak of no local transmission.

All the above cases are linked to a 28-year-old man who tested positive after completing 14-day mandatory quarantine in the central city of Da Nang.

As currently regulated, those who complete mandatory quarantine period shall continue be placed under medical surveillance at home for another 14 days.

Reiterating that protecting public health is the Government’s top priority, PM Pham ordered engagement of the whole political system in containing COVID-19 under the motto fighting the pandemic like fighting enemy.
